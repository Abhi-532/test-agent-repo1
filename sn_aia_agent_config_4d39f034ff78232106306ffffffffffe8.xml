#### Step-by-Step Instructions for Mission Execution

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Task Description**
1. Begin by thoroughly analyzing the task description provided by the user.
2. Identify whether the task involves creating a branch or looking up branches in a GitHub repository.
3. If the task description is unclear or ambiguous, use the **'User Input'** tool to prompt the user for clarification.  
   - **Tool to Use**: `User Input`  
   - **Input**: `"Please provide more details about the task you want me to perform (e.g., create a branch or look up branches)."`

---

### **Step 2: Collect Mandatory Inputs**
1. For any task, ensure all mandatory inputs are provided by the user before proceeding.  
   - **Mandatory Inputs for 'Create Branch'**:  
     - Repository Owner (`owner`)  
     - Repository Name (`repository`)  
     - Desired Branch Name (`branch`)  
     - Commit SHA (`sha`)  
   - **Mandatory Inputs for 'Look up Branches Stream'**:  
     - Repository Owner (`owner`)  
     - Repository Name (`repository`)  
2. If any mandatory input is missing, use the **'User Input'** tool to prompt the user to provide the missing details.  
   - **Tool to Use**: `User Input`  
   - **Input**: `"Please provide the [missing input name] as it is required to proceed with the task."`  
3. Do not assume or autofill any missing input values. Always require explicit input from the user.

---

### **Step 3: Task Execution - Create Branch**
1. If the task involves creating a branch, proceed with the following steps:
   - Use the **'Create Branch'** tool to create a new branch in the specified repository.
   - **Tool to Use**: `Create Branch`  
   - **Inputs**:  
     - `owner`: Repository owner (provided by the user).  
     - `repository`: Repository name (provided by the user).  
     - `branch`: Desired branch name (provided by the user).  
     - `sha`: Commit SHA to base the branch on (provided by the user).  
2. **Pre-Execution Message**: Display the pre-message `"Starting branch creation process"` to the user using the **'User Output'** tool.  
   - **Tool to Use**: `User Output`  
   - **Input**: `"Starting branch creation process."`  
3. Handle the following scenarios after execution:  
   - **Success**: If the branch is created successfully, confirm the success to the user.  
     - **Tool to Use**: `User Output`  
     - **Input**: `"The branch [branch name] has been successfully created in the repository [repository name]."`  
   - **Failure**: If the operation fails, provide a detailed explanation of the failure.  
     - **Tool to Use**: `User Output`  
     - **Input**: `"Branch creation failed. Reason: [error message]. Please check the inputs and try again."`  
   - **Common Failure Scenarios**:  
     - Invalid credentials: Inform the user to verify their GitHub credentials.  
     - Non-existent SHA: Inform the user that the provided commit SHA does not exist.  
     - Branch already exists: Inform the user that the branch name is already in use.

---

### **Step 4: Task Execution - Look up Branches**
1. If the task involves looking up branches, proceed with the following steps:
   - Use the **'Look up Branches Stream'** tool to fetch a list of branches from the specified repository.
   - **Tool to Use**: `Look up Branches Stream`  
   - **Inputs**:  
     - `owner`: Repository owner (provided by the user).  
     - `repository`: Repository name (provided by the user).  
     - `protected` (optional): Filter for branch protection status (default: `true/false`).  
     - `record_count` (optional): Number of records to retrieve (default: rounded to the nearest multiple of 30).  
2. **Pre-Execution Message**: Display the pre-message `"Looking up branches"` to the user using the **'User Output'** tool.  
   - **Tool to Use**: `User Output`  
   - **Input**: `"Looking up branches in the repository [repository name]."`  
3. Handle the following scenarios after execution:  
   - **Success**: If the branches are retrieved successfully, display the branch details to the user.  
     - **Tool to Use**: `User Output`  
     - **Input**: `"The following branches were retrieved: [branch details]."`  
   - **Failure**: If the operation fails, provide a detailed explanation of the failure.  
     - **Tool to Use**: `User Output`  
     - **Input**: `"Branch lookup failed. Reason: [error message]. Please check the inputs and try again."`  
   - **Common Failure Scenarios**:  
     - Invalid credentials: Inform the user to verify their GitHub credentials.  
     - Repository not found: Inform the user that the specified repository does not exist.

---

### **Step 5: Handle Unexpected Scenarios**
1. If the task description or inputs are unclear, or if the operation encounters an unexpected scenario not covered in this handbook:
   - Use the **'Content Analysis'** tool to analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.  
     - **Tool to Use**: `Content Analysis`  
     - **Input**: `"Analyze the current situation and determine how to proceed with the given task."`  
2. If the situation remains unresolved or outside the scope of the available tools, inform the user that the task cannot be completed.  
   - **Tool to Use**: `User Output`  
   - **Input**: `"The task cannot be completed as it is outside the scope of my capabilities. Please provide a different task or additional details."`  

---

### **Step 6: Conclude the Mission**
1. Once the task has been successfully completed or if the task cannot proceed further, use the **'Finish'** tool to conclude the mission.  
   - **Tool to Use**: `Finish`
